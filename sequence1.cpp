// 1. The number of items in the sequence is stored in the member variable
// used.
// 2. For an empty sequence, we do not care what is stored in any of data; for
// a non-empty sequence, the items are stored in their sequence order from
// data[0] to data[used-1], and we donâ€™t care what is stored in the rest of
// data.
// 3. If there is a current item, then it lies in data[current_index]; if there is
// no current item, then current_index equals used
